Frame
=====

The actual frame is actualy the third version. The design for move modelisation
is based on differential-drive wheeled robot, controlled by pwm (pulse-width
modulation). There are 2 freewheels and 2 motorized wheel, arranged diagonaly.

outline of wheel's disposition:
	(F) : freewheel
	(M) : motorized wheel

	(M)------(F)

	(F)------(M)

Case
====

The objectif of the frame is to host the drone, by secure and recharge it.
For the recharge, the case top need two copper pad on wich the specific drone's pad
can make electric contact.

The drone position can be secure by some electro magnet, place under the surface

Wheels
======

Wheels need to be high enough to pass over little obstacle.
The distance floor <-> frame bottom chosen is about 5cm.

Motor
=====

To select the motor correctly, the most important criterion is the engine couple.
Because the global weight of the "frame + case + battery + motor" might be
substantial.

Battery
=======

The voltage choosen is 12V. Be careful to the comsuption of the motor at full
accelleration, it can be regulate by software to slow down the acceleration.
